# Aurity

<h2>Introduction</h2>


It comes off as no surprise AR will become the new interface between humans and machines. Keeping this in mind I came with Aurity. It is the next step to Augmented Reality. What if you were able to control reality with a voice command? Reality cannot be controlled with voice, but we can control Augmented reality with the help of our voice.

The Objective of the project is to take the next step towards augmented reality we have seen many things in the field of augmented reality, but some fields are still to be looked upon one of such field is augmented reality controlled by Voice command. I am planning to work on augmented reality controlled by the voice of user.

This technology is at the very forefront of the global digital revolutionâ€“ it is integrated into solutions across multiple industries. AR offers customers product visualization, which allows them to see and demo products before purchasing them. Aurity will be taking a step forward in the field of Augmented Reality. The whole world created with the help of Aurity will be Controlled by the help of voice command. If we can control AR with voice, it will remove the Problem of Searching about over and over we just call up anything with help of a single command.

<h2>Solution Approach</h2>

The main Aim of my project will be to operate Augmented Reality with help of our voice command. This will be a step towards the progress of Augmented Reality.

Using voice interaction with augmented reality can really benefit the user by making the interaction fast and effortless. The working of things will be much more convenient when we are able to control AR objects with the help of our voice.

<h2>Methodology</h2>
Application development is the process of creating a computer program or a set of programs to perform the different tasks that a business requires. From calculating monthly expenses to scheduling sales reports, applications help businesses automate processes and increase efficiency. Every app-building process follows the same steps: gathering requirements, designing prototypes, testing, implementation, and integration.

Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic and olfactory.AR can be defined as a system that incorporates three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects.

Combining these together with the little help of NLP and sceneform for Augmented Reality I am trying to create aurity.

<h2>Outcome</h2>
My Project will mainly focus on Augmented Reality operated with the help of voice command given by the user. Using voice interaction with augmented reality can really benefit the user by making the interaction fast and effortless. The working of things will be much more convenient when we are able to control the AR objects with the help of our voice. Further it can be used in VIRTUAL REALITY
SMART GLASSES and many more things which we can expect in the future.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The Project is mainly focused on Advancing in the field of Augmented Reality with the help of NLP and 3D elements with Unity. In the future as mentioned above I am planning to bring the project in Virtual Reality as well and one more feature that we can expect will be of adding custom 3D Figures created in unity and giving them a custom name by the user.
